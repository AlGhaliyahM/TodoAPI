# Road Map

### Alignment is the key.

Align who's handling with feature.

### Busniess Logic:

- [AlGhaliyah] Create Todo task
- [AlGhaliyah] GetAll Todo
- [AlGhaliyah] Get Todo By ID
- [Abdulaziz] Update Todo task >> (isdone? update date should be changed here)
- [Abdulaziz] Delete Todo

### Extras:

- Sign Up
- Log in
- Each user should be linked with Todo
- JWT
- Dockarization

### Side Notes:

- Use PostgreSQL
- Use TypeORM
